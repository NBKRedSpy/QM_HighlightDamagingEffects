# Quasimorph Highlight Damaging Effects

**Important**: The game's version .8 and higher now includes similar functionality.  This mod is no longer supported.

Highlights the wound icon when it is causing damage.

When in the middle of battle, it can be difficult to notice that a new -2 HP per action point wound has been added to the existing wounds.

This mod highlights the wound boxes that are causing damage.

The color can be changed in the configuration file.

## Game Difficulty
The game notifies a player that they are taking damage by flashing the wound and player as well as making a "crunching" sound.  The subtly of the notification may be a gameplay decision.  

For example, in combat a person can be filled with so much adrenaline that they are unaware that they are wounded.

If that is the game's intent, this mod would be considered a difficulty reduction rather than a QoL.

However, since I was checking the wound panels constantly, it is more of a QoL for me.

# Configuration
