[h1]Quasimorph Highlight Damaging Effects[/h1]


Highlights the wound icon when it is causing damage.

When in the middle of battle, it can be difficult to notice that a new -2 HP per action point wound has been added to the existing wounds.

This mod highlights the wound boxes that are causing damage.

The color can be changed in the configuration file.

[h2]Game Difficulty[/h2]

The game notifies a player that they are taking damage by flashing the wound and player as well as making a "crunching" sound.  The subtly of the notification may be a gameplay decision.

For example, in combat a person can be filled with so much adrenaline that they are unaware that they are wounded.

If that is the game's intent, this mod would be considered a difficulty reduction rather than a QoL.

However, since I was checking the wound panels constantly, it is more of a QoL for me.

[h1]Configuration[/h1]

The configuration file will be created on the first game run and can be found at [i]%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\Quasimorph\QM_HighlightDamagingEffects\config.json[/i].
